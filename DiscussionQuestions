############################# RECURSION ###############################
1. In your own words, what is Recursion?

Recursion is the process of a function calling itself. It is clear that
a recursive function is needed when the same steps are repeated and
the result of a function is continguent on the response received from the 
previous function call. 

2. Why is it necessary to have a Base Case?

A Base Case is needed to define a scenario that does not require recursion. 
In computer science, you need to be able to tell the function what to do
when it stops recursing. When defining my base case, I think of it like this:

"What is the smallest version of this data type that I can apply this logic to?
What should happen when the function arrives at the base case?"

############################## GRAPHS ################################
1. What is a Graph?
A graph is a group of nodes that are connected by edges. Graphs are 
non-directed, meaning there is not a node that is at the top of the graph
as we have seen in a tree. Each node has what is called an adjacency list 
which contains all of the nodes that are directly connected to it (adjacent). 

2. How is a Graph different from a Tree?
A graph is much like a tree, except that it contains loops. In a tree
the relationships are one direction, but in a graph they can be directed
or non-directed (meaning they go both directions).

3. Give an example of somthing that would be good to model with a Graph.

The best example that I like to use for a graph is Facebook. The connections between friends demonstrate a social graph. The people are the nodes and the edges are the friendships. At the state where all friends are connected it is a undirected graph. The graph of friend requests is a directed graph because only one person can request to be a friend (one direction). Facebook graph is also cyclic since there is no inherent hierarchy. An example of an Acyclic graph is a tree.

############################## SORTING ################################
1. Describe in words how the Bubble Sort algorithm works.
The bubble sort algorithm basically compares adjacent values in a list 
and moves the larger of the two numbers to left. Naturally, by doing this, 
the largest number bubbles to the end of the list. This happens again until
the next largest number is right next to the largest number. This process
is repeated until all of the numbers are sorted from least to greatest. 


2. Describe in words how the Merge Sort algorithm works.
Merge sort breaks down the list until each value in the list has only one 
element in it. This is done by splitting the list in half [relatively speaking]
until all lists have only one element. At this level the items are compared 
with the adjacent list to it and rearranged so that the list with the smallest 
number is on the left. Once a level is sorted with these pairs, merge sort 
is then applied to pairs of pairs, these lists are ordered and this process 
is continued until the orginal list is sorted. 

3. Describe in words how the Quick Sort algorithm works. 
With quick sort, you chose a pivot element which can be anywhere in the list. 
Once the pivot element is chosen, quick sort puts all of the numbers lower
than the pivot to the left and all the number higher than the pivot to the 
right. Within each partition, a new pivot element is chosen and quick sort
is applied again and again until the list is sorted. 

########################### GIT BRANCHING #############################
1. Give an instance when you would use git branching.
When you are working on a feature but do not want to deploy it with the 
main product yet. In this scenario you can create a different branch that 
can have a copy of the master product on it with your changes so you can test
your feature. When you are ready to deploy the feature you can merge the changes
you have made with the master branch. 

2. What is a pull request?
A pull request is you telling your manager or admin on a project that you have
a branch with awesome features that you want to be merged onto the master branch. 
You are asking that they do a code review and if everything looks good, they will
grant the merge.
